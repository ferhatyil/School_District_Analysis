# School District Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
We helped Maria, the chief data scientist for a city school district, to remove reading and math grades for ninth graders at Thomas High School and replace them with "NaN"s because the school board had come across some evidence of academic dishonesty.
### Results
We re-analyzed the district grade dataset.
Firstly, we removed 9th grade reading and math scores from our data and replaced with NaN for Thomas High School.

#####Removing the grades affected the analysis:

- Brought overall district passing  average down to 64.9%.
- Brought overall school passing average from 91% down to 65%.
- Lowered Thomas High School's performance rate significantly. Even though its score is still better than district schools, it's much lower than charter schools.
- There are no significant changes observed with spending range. 

		The first chart outputs the original results, second chart is the updated results.

## Summary

- We observed that the district's overall pass rate fell to 64.9%.
- Even though Thomas High School's ranking did not drop into bottom five school's list, its overall passing percentage fell significantly.
- Thomas High School's adjusted overall passing rate still performs better that other district schools.
- Removing the math and reading scores did not affect school spending.
