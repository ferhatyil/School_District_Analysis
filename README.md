# School District Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
We helped Maria, the chief data scientist for a city school district, to remove reading and math grades for ninth graders at Thomas High School and replace them with NaNs because the school board had come across some evidence of academic dishonesty.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

In this worksheet, we analyzed the number of successful, failed, and canceled projects and their percentages all based on campaign's goal amount. While the most successful campaign in terms of percentages was in the less than $1000 bracket, the highest number of successful campaigns were in the $1000-4999 bracket.
The line chart below demonstrated the campaign. Every goal range returned at least one successful campaign except for $45000 to $49999 row which had zero successful campaigns.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
In either worksheet, there were challenges that required web research. Until getting familiar with Excel, finding formulas are heavily relied on class notes and web search.




## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

	**1.**  May and June were the most successful months.
	
	**2.** There is a small amount of canceled campaigns throughout and none in October.


- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

	- The lower the goal is the higher the number of successful campaigns are.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
	- We are not able to see why some campaigns were more successful than others or why they were failed and/or canceled.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
 	- For the Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date table, We can use clustered column chart. For the Outcomes Based on Goal, we can use 2-D bar chart.
